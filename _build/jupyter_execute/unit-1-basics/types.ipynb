    "Variables are named storage locations that can hold values and are used to store values that may change during a program's execution. Types are categories of values, and every value belongs to a specific type. Programming languages have many types, including primitive types (such as numbers and booleans) and composite types (such as arrays and user-defined objects).\n",

    "These types can be Immutable or Mutable. Immutable types are types whose fields cannot be changed after the type is created. Mutable types are types whose fields can be modified after they are created. For example, a `Student` type might have a `sid` and a `netid` data fields, where `sid` is an integer type and `netid` is a string type. User-defined composite types are a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating data.\n",

    "## Expressions and Variables\n",
    "Expressions are a combination of values, variables, and operators that _evaluate_ to a single value. A _variable_ is like a box that holds a value, and that value has a _type_. For example, types can be numbers such as `3`, Boolean values like `true` or `false`, or text like:\n",

    ">\"Your computer is the only thing in the universe that unconditionally loves you, perhaps excluding your mother. Your computer will do anything you ask it to do with no pushback and no attitude. You just need to know how to talk to it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, computers and Humans don't speak the same language. Humans understand that `3` is an integer, i.e., `3`$\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, and `Julia rocks` is text, but the computer doesn't see these values the same way we do. Expressions are a fundamental building block of most programming languages, and they are used to perform calculations, compare values, and assign values to variables. Here are some common examples of expressions in the [Julia programming language](https://docs.julialang.org):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `2 + 3`: This expression evaluates to the value `5`, an `integer`. \n",
    "* `x * y`: This expression evaluates to the product of the variables `x` and `y`, which are assumed to be numbers. However, `x` and `y` can be other types, e.g., text, and the `*` operator will perform a different operation, e.g., string concatenation.\n",
    "* `x == y`: This expression evaluates to `true` if `x` and `y` are equal and `false` if they are not; `true` and `false` are Boolean types, i.e., `true`$\\in\\mathbb{B}$ and `false`$\\in\\mathbb{B}$ where $\\mathbb{B} = \\left\\{\\text{true}, \\text{false}\\right\\}$.\n",
    "* `x > y`: This expression evaluates to `true` if `x` is greater than `y` and `false` if it is not; `true` and `false` are Boolean types. This statement assumes `x` and `y` are numbers. However, `x` and `y` can be other types. For example, if they are text, the `>` operator will perform a different operation, e.g., lexicographic comparison.\n",
    "* `x = 3`: This expression assigns the value `3` to the variable `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are evaluated to a value that has a type. For example, the expression `2 + 3` evaluates to the value `5`, an integer. The expression `x = 3` assigns the value `3` to an integer variable `x.` The expression `x == y` evaluates to `true` or `false,` which are Boolean values. The expression `x * y` evaluates to the product of the variables `x` and `y`, which are assumed to be numbers. However, `x` and `y` can be other types, e.g., text, and the `*` operator will perform a different operation, e.g., string concatenation.\n",

    "## Numerical and Logical Data Types\n",
    "For a computer, everything is a [binary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), i.e., numbers written to the `base 2`.  From this perspective, integers are binary numbers, text is a set of binary numbers, Boolean values are binary numbers, etc.  In many traditional programming languages, it is required to declare the variable type before using it so that the computer, i.e., the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) or [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) that is processing your code, can check the correctness of the program and allocate the appropriate amount of memory to store the variable. While most modern languages can guess (or infer) the type, declaring types is still good practice because it helps with the readability of the compute code. \n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:remark} Why do we need Types?\n",
    "Types are an essential concept in programming, and they are used to ensure the correctness and efficiency of your code. Modern languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) have sophisticated type systems that include basic numerical, logical, and text types, and they allow you to create your own types and define how they interact with other types. However, some languages, such as [Python](https://www.python.org), hide the type system from the user, while other languages, such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), expose the type system to the user. \n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "But how are types represented on the computer? At the smallest scale, information is stored as bits and bytes in the computer ({numref}`fig-64-bit-byte-label-example`)\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A `bit` is the smallest unit of storage on a computer; a `bit` is a `0` or a `1`. However, a `bit` is too tiny for practical computing tasks. Instead, `bits` are grouped into `bytes`; a group of 8 bits equals  1 $\\times$ `byte.` Different types of things, e.g., integers or text, are then represented as different numbers of `bytes.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers, floating-points, and logical values are the basic building blocks of arithmetic and computation. Built-in representations of these values, i.e., the structure that the computer understands, are called `numeric primitives.` On the other hand, the models of numbers that humans understand, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, etc., are called numeric literals, e.g., `1` is an integer literal, and `1.0` is a floating-point literal. Modern programming languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) provide a broad range of primitive numeric types. Further, many standard mathematical operations are defined over them, e.g., addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric primitives, which the computer understands, are binary numbers (numbers written to the `base 2`). However, there are other number systems that you may encounter, e.g., numbers written in the `base 8` (octal) or `base 16` (hexadecimal) system ({prf:ref}`defn-number-system`):\n",

    "Boolean values, e.g., values of `true` and `false` are represented in modern languages using a `Bool` type. For example, both [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) have built-in Boolean types. However, foundational languages such as the [C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) do not have a dedicated Boolean type; instead, Boolean values in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) were represented by integers, i.e., `true = 1` and `false = 0`. Thus, it should not be surprising that in languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), which is a distant relative of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), `Bool` is implemented as a subtype of integer (a special `8-bit` integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), values of the `Bool` type are a kind of number: `false` is numerically equal to `0` while true is equivalent to `1`. However, unlike an `Int64`, only 1$\\times$byte (8-bits) is required to store a `Bool` value in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org); because a `Bool` can only assume one of two possible values the computer doesn't need to use extra storage:"

Later, `8-bit` character mappings were developed, i.e., the so-called [extended ASCII systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII), which had $0,\\dots,255$ possible character values. \n",

    "However, modern languages use sophisticated built-in `String` types constructed using the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) character set. \n",
    "* The [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) standard encodes approximately 1.1 million possible characters; the first 128 of these are the same as the original ASCII set. [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters, which use up to 4$\\times$bytes (32-bits) of storage per character, are indexed using the `base 16` (hexadecimal) number systems.\n",

    "__Solution__: The character `J` has index 74 in the ASCII table (which is included in the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) system). Thus, first, we must convert 74 to a `base 16` (hexadecimal) number and then convert that to the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) index format; [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) indexes left-pad the hexadecimal character value with zeros until a 4-digit code is generated, and then `U+` is appended to the four-digit code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hexadecimal numbers use decimal digits and six extra symbols; the decimal values $(0,1,\\dots,9)$, and the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F where hexadecimal A = decimal 10, through hexadecimal F = decimal 15 are used in the hexadecimal numbering system.\n",

    "* Step 1: Divide the given decimal number by 16 and write down the quotient and remainder\n",
    "* Step 2: Divide the previous quotient by 16 and write down the quotient and remainder\n",
    "* Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the quotient equals zero.\n",
    "* Step 4: Map all the remainder values to their corresponding hexadecimal equivalents \n",
    "* Step 5: Starting with the last value and moving to the first, write each of the hexadecimal values\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compute the hexadecimal equivalent of 74:\n",

    "| value | quotient | remainder | hex code |\n",

    "## Composite types\n",
    "Composite types are custom data types made up of one or more other types. Let's start with two simple composite types: [arrays](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/#lib-arrays) and [structs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Composite-Types).  Later, we'll consider some additional composite types, e.g., [tuples](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Tuple-Types-1) and [dictionaries](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/collections/#Dictionaries-1) which have unique properties that make them useful for specific tasks. An `array` is a composite data type that theoretically allows any data to be stored in a sequence of elements. Arrays can be `read-only` in that they have a fixed size and cannot be modified after they are created, or `read-write` in the sense that they can be changed after they are made. On the other hand, A `struct` is a composite data type that allows data to be stored in named fields. `Structs` can be `read-only,` i.e., Immutable, or `read-write,` i.e., Mutable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You define a struct by using the `struct` keyword followed by a name for the struct and a list of field names and types. For example, let's define an immutable `Student` struct that has a `sid` and a `netid` field:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "struct Student\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # data fields \n",
    "    sid::Int64\n",
    "    netid::String\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "# build an instance -\n",
    "student = Student(1,\"xyz123\"); # we pass the required data into the struct as args \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutable struct is a struct whose fields can be modified after creation. You can create a mutable struct by using the `mutable struct` keyword instead of struct and by adding a _constructor_ method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "mutable struct Student\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # data fields \n",
    "    sid::Int64\n",
    "    netid::String\n",
    "\n",

    "student = Student(); # contains no data\n",
    "student.sid = 1\n",
    "student.netid = \"xyz123\" # we add data using the \"dot\" notation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The struct composite data type contains only data; in the examples above, the `Student` datatype holds two values, `sid` is an integer type, and `netid` is a string type. Except for the special case of the constructor on the mutable `Student` struct, composite types in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) do not have functions attached to them. \n",

In purer object-oriented languages, such as [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), all values are objects whether they are composites or not. In less refined object-oriented languages, including [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/), some values, such as integers and floating-point values, are not objects, while instances of user-defined composite types are true objects with associated methods. In [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), all values are objects, but functions are not bundled with the objects they operate on. \n",

    "In this lecture, we introduced expressions, variables, and types. Understanding these is fundamental to writing programs in any programming language.\n",

    "* Variables are named storage locations that can hold values. They are used to store values that may change during a program's execution. \n",
